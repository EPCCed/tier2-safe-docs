DiRAC SAFE Overview
===================

The SAFE is a web-based application that is used for:

* Administering DiRAC user accounts
* Reporting on usage of the system
* Helpdesk and support

DiRAC SAFE for individual users
-------------------------------

All DiRAC users have accounts on the DiRAC SAFE through which they can
view the resources they have access to, administer their account,
query their usage of the service, and submit support requests.

More information on performing these tasks can be found in the
:doc:`safe-guide-users` chapter.

DiRAC SAFE for project leaders
------------------------------

Project leaders (PI's and any designated project managers) can also
use the SAFE to approve requests to join the project,
and generate reports on the project 
usage on DiRAC.

More information on performing these tasks can be found in the
:doc:`safe-guide-pi` chapter.
