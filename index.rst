This is the documentation for the SAFE service management web interface provided
by `EPCC <http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk>`_ for the EPSRC Tier 2 HPC facilities.

The Tier-2 HPC facilities currently integrated into the SAFE service are:

* `Cirrus <http://www.cirrus.ac.uk>`__ from `EPCC <http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk>`__
* Athena from `HPC Midlands+ <http://www.hpc-midlands-plus.ac.uk>`__
* `Isambard <http://gw4.ac.uk/isambard/>`__ from `GW4 <http://gw4.ac.uk/>`__
* `CSD3 <https://www.csd3.cam.ac.uk/high-performance-computing>`__ from `University of Cambridge Research Computing Services <https://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk>`__

The Tier-2 SAFE service provides a common, web-based interface for managing 
access and resources across the Tier-2 HPC services and allows for coherent 
reporting from Tier-2 facilities.

Tier-2 SAFE Overview
--------------------

The SAFE is a web-based application that is used for:

* Administering user accounts and projects on the various Tier-2 HPC facilities
* Reporting on usage of the various Tier-2 facilities

Tier-2 SAFE for individual users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All users on any of the integrated Tier-2 users have accounts on the Tier-2
SAFE through which they can view the resources they have access to, administer
their accounts on the various Tier-2 facilities and query their usage of 
the various Tier-2 facilities.

Tier-2 SAFE for project leaders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Project leaders (PI's and any designated project managers) can also
use the SAFE to approve requests to join the project from individual
users and generate reports on the project usage on the Tier-2 facilities
the project has access to.
